# Go, HTMX, and PicoCSS Layout

This is an expanded version of the [template fragments example](https://gist.github.com/benpate/f92b77ea9b3a8503541eb4b9eb515d8a) as advocated by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/).

It uses a common [master template](master.html.tmpl) (styled with PicoCSS), so that the individual pages do not have to repeat common elements.
